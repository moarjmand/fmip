# What only the maintainer can do

**Why this file exists.** An agent session can write, test, review and merge, but
there are things it must not do: create an account, spend money, hold a secret,
touch a physical device, or make a judgement the blueprint does not already
contain (`CLAUDE.md` §7). Those things are listed here, in the order in which
they unblock work, so that the list is a document rather than something
reconstructed from memory at the start of each session.

Each entry says what it is, **why it is yours and not an agent's**, what it
unblocks, and how to know it worked.

## Done

| | | When |
|---|---|---|
| The six policy defaults | Thresholds, the conduct ladder, how a grant ends, the two rules versions (`13-policy.md` §1–§5, D-059) | 2026-09-15 |
| The two member-facing texts | The platform rules and the contributor rules — the words a member accepts (`13-policy.md` §4, §5) | 2026-09-15 |
| The news licence question | Free publisher feeds, rights carried per source rather than assumed (D-061) | 2026-09-15 |
| The public preview | A Render service and a Neon database. Live at `https://fmip-preview.onrender.com`; the stream carries over the single published port, which is what T-086 was for (D-064) | 2026-09-15 |

These were judgements, not tasks: what a platform asks of its members is not
derivable from the code, and an agent that picked them would have been inventing
product.

## 1. The Arabic translator (T-150)

**Why yours.** It is the one thing in this product that must be done by a person
who speaks the language. T-151 already settled the workflow and the rule that
makes the wait safe: **an untranslated string is visibly untranslated, never
machine output presented as a translation.** So `/ar` can ship incomplete and
still be honest — which is why this is not blocking anything.

**What it unblocks.** Nothing. It improves `/ar`, which already routes, formats,
sorts and lays out right-to-left correctly (T-152, T-153).

## 2. The paid data provider (T-100)

**Why yours.** It is a purchase. `CLAUDE.md` §7: no session spends money.

**What it unblocks.** T-101 (player-level match statistics), T-103 (injuries and
suspensions), and the rest of the depth that a free tier does not carry.

**What the decision rests on.** The bake-off ran seven times and is written up in
`docs/05-data-providers.md`; D-049 records what was decided when this was first
deferred. T-025 — the Phase 1 version of the same gate — is deferred under D-033
and stays deferred until you say otherwise.

## 3. The production deploy (T-074)

**Why yours.** It runs on a machine that does not exist yet, and buying it is a
purchase.

**What it unblocks.** The product having a home. `docs/09-deploy.md` is the
runbook; it was rehearsed end to end on 2026-09-12 and is open only because
nobody has run it on a VPS.

**Before it:** rerun the load test (`docs/08-load-test.md`) against the VPS, not
against a laptop.

## 4. The launch review, and the install tap (T-084)

**Why yours.** One is a judgement — does this meet the exit criteria in
`01-roadmap.md` — and the other needs a physical Android device to confirm the
PWA installs from the browser's own prompt. A headless browser can assert the
manifest is valid; it cannot assert that Chrome offered to install it.

**Outcome:** signed off in `00-decisions.md`.

## 5. Two members on the preview -- withdrawn on 2026-09-17

This asked you to register two accounts on the preview and fish their
verification links out of the service log, so the rest of Phase 3's exit
criteria could be walked. It is gone, and nothing replaced it for you.

Those criteria are now `apps/web/tests/e2e/journeys/social.spec.ts`: two
members, registered through the real form and verified from the real message,
against the real API, database and seed, on every pull request. The preview
walk would have been one observation, on one day, by one person, and it could
not have been repeated without that person. This is one on every commit -- and
it checks the criterion the preview could never have checked at all, because
messages arriving in real time needs a Redis the preview does not have.

If you ever want members on the preview for your own use, the procedure was:
register at `/en/register`, find the line beginning `[mail] to=` in the Render
logs, and open the `verify-email` link in it. Nothing in the project waits on
it any more.

## 6. Standing: approving contributors and analysts

**Why yours.** `13-policy.md` §3: a grant is a row that names its approver and
their reason. "The system approved it" is not an approver, which is the whole
point of recording one.

Eligibility is computed and never grants (T-250). What you see is a list of
members who **could** be approved; approving is a separate act, by a person,
with a reason that is stored.
